## 🚀 Why Simplify?

| Goal | Description |
|------|--------------|
| 🧮 **1rem = 10px** | Makes layout, spacing, and typography math effortless. |
| 🧱 **Predictable Layout Model** | Universal `box-sizing: border-box` keeps layouts stable. |
| ⚖️ **Framework-Safe** | Integrates cleanly with any frontend stack or UI system. |
| ♿ **Accessible by Default** | Retains focus visibility and native text scaling. |
| 💡 **Zero Visual Opinion** | Leaves color, font, and spacing choices entirely to you. |
| 🧩 **Mount Isolation** | Prevents stacking leaks across React, Vue, and Svelte roots. |
